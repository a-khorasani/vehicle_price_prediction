# vehicle_price_prediction
This is a project for predict the price of vehicles. i used a dataset which contains some features for vehicles like ''year'', "transmission", "engine", "fuel tank capacity" and etc. 
Before train the model i cleaned the dataset and prepared it to use it for train and after that i used KNeighborRegressor for training the model and i got 90% accuracy of that.
